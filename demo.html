                        <p>Hip-hop dance refers to street dance styles primarily performed to hip-hop music or that have evolved as part 
                        of hip-hop culture. It includes a wide range of styles primarily breaking, locking, and popping which were 
                        created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States. The television show Soul Train and 
                        the 1980s films Breakin’, Beat Street, and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in their early 
                        stages; therefore, giving hip-hop mainstream exposure. The dance industry responded with a commercial, 
                        studio-based version of hip-hop—sometimes called “new style”—and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance 
                        called “jazz-funk”. Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to choreograph from 
                        the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street. Because of this development, hip-hop dance is practiced 
                        in both dance studios and outdoor spaces.</p>
